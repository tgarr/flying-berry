# Flying Berry
Flying Berry is a DIY quadcopter drone powered by a Raspberry Pi

This project includes a flight controller written in C++, intended to run on the
Rasperry Pi, as well as 3D models to print the whole frame.

Some current and future features of the Flying Berry:
- Runs everything on the Raspberry Pi: currently using an old Raspberry Pi 1, model B, revision 2, from 2012 (700MHz, 512MB)
- 3D printable frame
- Sensor fusion with a complementary filter
- Stabilize and rate flight modes
- Controlled by a Steam Controller (for now)
- Digital HD FPV through OpenHD (hopefully)
- Radio Controller support through OpenHD (hopefully)
