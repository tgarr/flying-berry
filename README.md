# Flying Berry
Flying Berry is a DIY quadcopter drone powered by a Raspberry Pi 1 B rev2.

This project includes a flight controller written in C++, along with
instructions for building and configuring the drone, from hardware to software.

Some current and future features of the Flying Berry:
- Runs everything on the old Raspberry Pi 1, model B, revision 2, from 2012 (700MHz, 512MB)
- 3D printable frame (I'm using a generic one from Thingiverse, but I'll
  hopefully design my own in the future)
- Sensor fusion with a complementary filter
- Configuration file for easy tuning (instead of hard coded parameters)
- Stabilize and rate flight modes
- Automated maneuvers, such as take-off and landing
- Controlled by a Steam Controller
- FPV through an Android application
